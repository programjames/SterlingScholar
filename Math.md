*Brief Explanation:*  
The Putnam is the most prestigious undergarduate math competition in the United States. In the 2020–2021 school year it was administered unofficially online, which allowed me to take it while still in high school. I ended up scoring a 50/120, well within the top 100 in the nation and the highest score in Utah. The Putnam is a brutally hard test. For reference, the median score was an 8/120, the highest undergrad at BYU scored a 20/120, and the cutoff for the top 100 was a 39/120 (which happened to be the exact score one other student from Timpview received). BYU is now recruiting me for their Putnam team, and the math department has offered me a full ride scholarship on top of any other scholarship BYU gives me to compete for them.

*Impact:*  
The Putnam helped me love competition math again. In 8th grade, my goal was to make the countdown round at National MATHCOUNTS, i.e. top twelve. When I placed 30th I was crushed. I knew it was still a respectable placement, but I also knew I could have done so much better. Then in 9th grade I took the AIME for the third time, hoping to make it to the next round. But due to several silly mistakes (e.g. adding two numbers together wrong) I ended up missing several problems I should have gotten, and failing to advance on.

I became apathetic towards competition math, until I started preparing for the Putnam in 10th grade. As opposed to MATHCOUNTS and the AIME, the Putnam is a proof-based competition, so making little arithmetic errors doesn't matter as much. For example, my three silly mistakes on the AIME brought my score down from an 110/150 to an 80/150. When I took the Putnam, I also made small errors on two questions, but it only slightly lowered my score from a 53 to a 50.

Morever, the problems on the Putnam are so interesting! You get six hours to solve twelve questions, so the problems involve a lot more thinking. They can include math from any subject—calculus, topology, and group theory are all free game, whereas in the AIME these topics aren't considered high school math so they don't show up. Preparing for the Putnam has been really fun. I've learned many more advanced math concepts, become a better problem solver, and found more math I can love.

As Math Club President, I was in charge of scheduling meetings and organizing competitions. I sent out weekly emails about our Math Madness ranking and when our next match would be, and I helped people register for the AMC 10/12B contest at BYU. When the Utah State Math Contest got cancelled, I organized everyone to take the Utah Math Olympiad (a smaller contest run by Hiram Golze around the same time), and we had seven people show up for the three-hour long exam. Finally, I decided to do something new: In our off weeks (from Math Madness) I taught the club about some of the coolest math topics including generating functions, expected value, and zero-sum games.

Also, I'd like to give a huge shoutout to Mrs. Crosland for bringing treats every week to Math Club and proctoring *a lot* of math competitions for us.

This year I am serving as the MATHCOUNTS coach for Centennial Middle School. We meet once a week after school. I create handouts and teach lessons to help them prepare for the MATHCOUNTS competition. We also take timed tests and practice speed math (e.g. gauntlets and the countdown round). Here are links to two handouts I've created: [Counting Handout](handouts/Counting.pdf), [Complex Intro Handout](handouts/ComplexIntro.pdf).

This is my first year coaching MATHCOUNTS, but I've been tutoring others math for much longer (informally and for free), which has helped me become a more effective teacher—many people have told me I'm really good at explaining difficult concepts. I love helping others love math as much as I do, so I'm always glad to help out!

**Describe two or three unique things about yourself and relate them to your category. If possible, include challenges you have overcome and describe any distinctive experiences that have affected you.**

I'm a twin, and in ninth grade I took many classes with juniors and seniors. This led to the issue where lots of people knew *of* me, but no one actually knew me. Random juniors and seniors would come up to me in the halls and ask, "Are you the Camacho twins? I've heard all about you!" It was weird, even a little creepy. I didn't know them, and I had no clue how they'd heard of me or why they thought it was appropriate to invade my mental space like that.

Plus, had they really heard all about me? If so, then why was I just called one of the Camacho twins? I was lucky to get a James-or-Joseph-but-I-can-never-remember-which-one-you-are. If they'd heard all about me, then how come they didn't even know the color of my skin? Many people thought I was Asian, because surely if someone's into math they must be Asian, and Camacho kinda sounds Asian-esque if you pronounce it Cuh-mah-chew. No, I'm not Asian, and no, I'm not just one half of a set of twins. I'm just as distinctive of a human being as every other human on the planet.

It was frustrating. I made a few friends at cross country and in the freshman classes I was taking, and it was nice to be treated like a person by them. But the pestering by the upperclassmen never did stop, not until they aged out of high school. It bothered me to be entirely identified by just one piece of my identity. I didn't just love math, I loved coding, chemistry, running, and even Fortnite too! I wasn't a mythological mathemagician—I was a person, just like them.

**How do you think your involvement in this category will enrich your life?**

I've planned to be a mathematician even as far back as first grade. Back then I was barely learning my times tables, and didn't know exactly what being a mathematician entailed, but the more I've learned the more I've loved the career. I did applied math research with Coreform over the summer, and it was fun to use generating functions to collapse a recursive algorithm into a clean two lines of code, or use the discrete cosine transform to multiply Chebyshev vectors in O(n log n) time instead of O(n^2). I've already been able to use the math I've learned to work on interesting problems. I know that in the future I'll continue to use it every day.
