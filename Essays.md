### Life Sketch
**Tell us about yourself in 250 words or less. State your name and where you were born. Include some personal details and tell the judges why you want to become a Sterling Scholar.**

My name is James Camacho. Born in Rochester, NY, I've since moved around the country, going to 3 different states, 3 different elementary schools, and 3 different middle schools. Luckily, I settled down in Provo in 8th grade, and have been attending Timpview High School the past four years.

I'm the 2.5th of 5 children, and my twin and I enjoy solving math problems together. We've competed against and challenged each other to do better in math competitions, making us both into greater mathematicians. In 7th grade we got the crazy idea to self-study calculus through MIT Open Courseware, and just went for it. Now we've both been admitted to MIT!

Other than math, I enjoy running XC with my team, reading books (though I have to be temperate in my reading habits, as several hours seemingly disappear when my finger opens the front cover of a book), playing bullet chess (and longer time settings, but bullet is the most addicting), and coding competitions.

I want to be the Sterling Scholar in Mathematics because I believe I have been a mathematics star throughout my academic career. Further, it was so cool to see what previous Sterling Scholars had done when I read through previous scholars' applications. I felt like I was making friends from ten years in the past. I want to be able to make that impression for future students.

Brief Explanation:
The Putnam is the most prestigious undergarduate math competition in the United States. In the 2020–2021 school year it was administered unofficially online, which allowed me to take it while still in high school. I ended up scoring a 50/120, well within the top 100 in the nation and the highest score in Utah. The Putnam is a brutally hard test. For reference, the median score was an 8/120, the highest undergrad at BYU scored a 20/120, and the cutoff for the top 100 was a 39/120. The BYU math department is now recruiting me for their Putnam team.

Impact:
The Putnam helped me love competition math again. In 8th grade, my goal was to make the countdown round at National MATHCOUNTS, i.e. top twelve. When I placed 30th I was crushed. I knew it was still a respectable placement, but I also knew I could have done so much better. Then in 9th grade I took the AIME for the third time, hoping to make it to the next round. But due to several silly mistakes (e.g. adding two numbers together wrong, something you learn in kindergarten) I ended up missing several problems I should have gotten, and failing to advance on.

I became apathetic towards competition math, until I started preparing for the Putnam in 10th grade. As opposed to MATHCOUNTS and the AIME, the Putnam is a proof-based competition, so making little arithmetic errors doesn't matter as much. For example, my three silly mistakes on the AIME brought my score down from an 110/150 to an 80/150. When I took the Putnam, I also made small (arithmetic) errors on two questions, but it only slightly lowered my score from a 53 to a 50.

Morever, the problems on the Putnam are so interesting! You get six hours to solve twelve questions, so the problems involve a lot more thinking. They can include math from any subject—calculus, topology, and group theory are all free game, whereas in the AIME these topics aren't considered high school math so they don't show up. Preparing for the Putnam has been really fun. I've learned many more advanced math concepts, become a better problem solver, and found more math I can love.

Outside of competition math, the Putnam seminar is the first class I "took" at BYU. In quotes, because I was too young to take concurrent enrollment classes, but the professor invited me to attend anyway. I've gotten to meet awesome professors in the math department and other fun math enthusiasts like myself in the class.

I've taken many more math classes, some of which have been very interesting (like MATH 411: Numerical Methods), but none have been as fun as the Putnam seminar. We get to talk and share our own solutions, our professor brings pizza and bagels (which unfortunately stopped with COVID), and get to really know each other. Several of my classmates are cousins, that was pretty cool to learn. I saw another one performing at a jazz concert. The test itself may only be six hours of a cold December day, but the Putnam is so much more to me.
