### Life Sketch
**Tell us about yourself in 250 words or less. State your name and where you were born. Include some personal details and tell the judges why you want to become a Sterling Scholar.**

My name is James Camacho. Born in Rochester, NY, I've since moved around the country, going to 3 different states, 3 different elementary schools, and 3 different middle schools. Luckily, I settled down in Provo in 8th grade, and have been attending Timpview High School the past four years.

I'm the 2.5th of 5 children, and my twin and I enjoy solving math problems together. We've competed against and challenged each other to do better in math competitions, making us both into greater mathematicians. In 7th grade we got the crazy idea to self-study calculus through MIT Open Courseware, and just went for it. Now we've both been admitted to MIT!

Other than math, I enjoy running XC with my team, reading books (though I have to be temperate in my reading habits, as several hours seemingly disappear when my finger opens the front cover of a book), playing bullet chess (and longer time settings, but bullet is the most addicting), and coding competitions.

I want to be the Sterling Scholar in Mathematics because I believe I have been a mathematics star throughout my academic career. Further, it was so cool to see what previous Sterling Scholars had done when I read through previous scholars' applications. I felt like I was making friends from ten years in the past. I want to be able to make that impression for future students.

Brief Explanation:
The Putnam is the most prestigious undergarduate math competition in the United States. In the 2020–2021 school year it was administered unofficially online, which allowed me to take it while still in high school. I ended up scoring a 50/120, well within the top 100 in the nation and the highest score in Utah. The Putnam is a brutally hard test. For reference, the median score was an 8/120, the highest undergrad at BYU scored a 20/120, and the cutoff for the top 100 was a 39/120. The BYU math department is now recruiting me for their Putnam team.

Impact:
The Putnam helped me love competition math again. In 8th grade, my goal was to make the countdown round at National MATHCOUNTS, i.e. top twelve. When I placed 30th I was crushed. I knew it was still a respectable placement, but I also knew I could have done so much better. Then in 9th grade I took the AIME for the third time, hoping to make it to the next round. But due to several silly mistakes (e.g. adding two numbers together wrong, something you learn in kindergarten) I ended up missing several problems I should have gotten, and failing to advance on.

I became apathetic towards competition math, until I started preparing for the Putnam in 10th grade. As opposed to MATHCOUNTS and the AIME, the Putnam is a proof-based competition, so making little arithmetic errors doesn't matter as much. For example, my three silly mistakes on the AIME brought my score down from an 110/150 to an 80/150. When I took the Putnam, I also made small (arithmetic) errors on two questions, but it only slightly lowered my score from a 53 to a 50.

Morever, the problems on the Putnam are so interesting! You get six hours to solve twelve questions, so the problems involve a lot more thinking. They can include math from any subject—calculus, topology, and group theory are all free game, whereas in the AIME these topics aren't considered high school math so they don't show up. Preparing for the Putnam has been really fun. I've learned many more advanced math concepts, become a better problem solver, and found more math I can love.

Outside of competition math, the Putnam seminar is the first class I "took" at BYU. In quotes, because I was too young to take concurrent enrollment classes, but the professor invited me to attend anyway. I've gotten to meet awesome professors in the math department and other fun math enthusiasts like myself in the class.

I've taken many more math classes, some of which have been very interesting (like MATH 411: Numerical Methods), but none have been as fun as the Putnam seminar. We get to talk and share our own solutions, our professor brings pizza and bagels (which unfortunately stopped with COVID), and get to really know each other. Several of my classmates are cousins, that was pretty cool to learn. I saw another one performing at a jazz concert.

The test itself may only be six hours of a cold December day, but the Putnam is so much more to me

### Leadership Essay

I've been a long-time advocate for STEM. In ninth grade I learned about the National Chemistry Olympiad (USNCO) and I wanted to participate. So I encouraged my chemistry class to take it with me and got our teacher (Dr. Shelton) to proctor it. That first year only eight people took it, but two years later nearly twenty people signed up for the exam. I can't take much credit for the increase, but it's exciting to see how much it’s grown.

In tenth grade I noticed Timpview didn't have a computer science club, so I created one. I came up with coding problems and made "lecture notes" for club meetings on topics like breadth first search or merge sort, staying up past midnight some weeks getting ready for the meeting. I only had a few active members, but it was fun to teach them stuff they couldn’t otherwise learn at school.

I was constantly inviting my members to participate in coding competitions with me, and tried to make the learning curve as flat as possible. For example, in December I invited everyone to my house to help them install Battlecode, because I remember it taking me several days when I was inexperienced, and I didn't want them to have the same struggles. Unfortunately only one member showed up, and he ended up not doing the competition at all. I persevered, and a few months later I came across this competition hosted by ACM UCSD called Energium, which was similar to Battlecode but a simpler challenge and easier to install. Again, I invited all my members to participate with me, and I even created documentation to help them get started. Unfortunately, again, nobody wanted to do it.

The computer science club ended up not being very successful. The next school year, all my members graduated or quit (it didn't help that COVID killed most clubs), and after a few weeks of nobody showing up I stopped running the club. I was disappointed, but I learned that I couldn't force people to love computer science. I could make it easier to learn and participate, but there is a large time commitment they would have to want to make on their own. I wouldn't want to spend ten hours a week writing poetry—even though I think it's cool—so I couldn't expect others to want to spend ten hours a week writing code.

I moved on and instead became the president of Math Club. It went a lot better! It helped that Timpview has had a Math Club for decades, and our teacher sponsor (Mrs. Crosland) always brought treats.

This time I taught the club about generating functions and expected value, and we participated in contests like Math Madness and the AMC 10/12. The Utah State Math Contest got cancelled that year due to COVID, so I organized our club to take the Utah Math Olympiad instead (run by Hiram Golze). I asked Mrs. Crosland to proctor it and seven people came; it's a smaller competition so that was one-third of all participants. I'm glad I was able to help out as Math Club president, and I hope I inspired my members to become better mathematicians.

### Community Service Essay

Teaching others math is so fun! I text my friends math problems on a regular basis, e.g. find the maximum value of x₁x₂+x₂x₃+⋅⋅⋅+xₙx₁ if x₁+x₂+⋅⋅⋅+xₙ=0 and x₁²+x₂²+⋅⋅⋅xₙ²=1. I give them a few days to stew over it, and if they can't figure it out I teach them how to do it using Lagrange multipliers and eigenvalues.

I don't just teach math, I also love the other STEM subjects! Just a few months ago at the end of term one, a friend texted me desperately needing help in her AP chemistry class. I spent five hours helping her review molarity and gas laws, and yes, she did end up getting an A.

I'm constantly inviting people to Math Club, Computer Science Club, and Science Bowl. I find coding or math contests on my own, and then tell my friends to take them with me (e.g. the CodinGame Spring 2020 challenge, or the Utah Math Olympiad). I've loved STEM my whole life, and I love helping others love it as much as me.

That's why for years I've wanted to be a MATHCOUNTS coach. I loved MATHCOUNTS in middle school, and in 8th grade Hiram Golze showed me the impact a great coach can have. He'd done MATHCOUNTS himself (and placed well at nationals), and knew what to teach and how to teach it. In the future I want to be as amazing a coach to others as he was for me, but I'm starting this year by coaching MATHCOUNTS at Centennial Middle School.

We meet once a week after school, and I create handouts (one is attached under "Supporting Documents") and teach lessons to help them prepare for the competition. We also take timed tests and practice speed math (e.g. gauntlets and the countdown round). It's cool to see my friends' younger siblings in the club or even one of my professor's children. We've been meeting for about 3 months now, and I'm excited to see how they do in the Chapter round coming up in February.

I recruited my twin brother to come help out, and one week I was sick so it was just him. He came back saying he felt he hadn't done a great job explaining number theory to the middle schoolers. I get that feeling, that's how I was when I first started answering posts on [artofproblemsolving.com](artofproblemsolving.com/community) (my username is "programjames1" if you want to check it out). However, after years of helping others to "get" math, it gets easier. Now my friends say I'm great at teaching math—maybe even better than their teachers—and (most of the time) I feel like my MATHCOUNTS students learn something new every club meeting.

### Unique Qualities Essay

I mentioned not placing as well as I hoped to in MATHCOUNTS. Let me expand on that. For years my goals had been getting loftier, but so were my cortisol levels. I still remember the state competition from sixth grade because of how stressed I was. I had gotten fourth in my chapter, but my goal was to make nationals, meaning I needed to repeat that placement at state. During the sprint round, my mind was racing, something I'd never really experienced before. It wasn't racing to solve the math problems as fast as possible, it was undergoing a fright-or-flight response.

As the day continued, my anxiety built. The target round passed and we had pizza for lunch, but I could hardly eat. Then came the team and cipher rounds. I didn't care for those, I just wanted to know my place. Finally, the announcer began reading the top six names. Places six and five were called out. Relief washed through me, they were not mine. I began celebrating But then... my name was not called next. It was some kid from Las Cruces. I wasn't fourth. Or third. I wanted to run away and cry. I had failed, I knew it, and my entire family and team now knew it too. But then, by some miracle, I was saved. "Second place goes to James Camacho from Eisenhower Middle School!"

I got lucky in sixth grade, but it also meant I didn't have to cope with defeat. Each year this stress would grow, until in 8th grade I was throwing up before every competition and could hardly sit up straight during the countdown round. It would've continued, except I didn't make my goal that final year. I had to learn how to fail.

I took a break from competitive math and developed other interests. In ninth grade I took up chemistry. In tenth grade I focused more on computer science. Outside of STEM, I became a runner. I started out the second-slowest runner on the team. I didn't hate running, but I didn't particularly like it either. Now I love running! I show up to practice excited to run seven miles through 15mph winds, 100 degree heat, or snowstorms thicker than a Wendy's frosty.

For the first time I was doing things solely because I enjoyed them, it didn't matter how well I placed. Getting first at my school in the USNCO felt great, but losing to Nathan Pace every cross country race still gave me a runner's high. These different activities may have began as a distraction from my MATHCOUNTS defeat, but I quickly grew to love them. And as I grew to love chemistry, computer science, and running, I began to regain my love for math.

When I came back to math, I came back for the math, not the competition. In middle school my attitude was all about winning. Making nationals, winning state, or making the countdown round. Now I do math because I love it.

### Life Enrichment Essay

"O Say, What is Truth" (#272) is one of the lesser known hymns, but it did show up in General Conference a few years ago. I liked the words, so I memorized them and learned to play it on the piano. I particularly love the second verse:

Yes, say, what is truth? 'Tis the brightest prize
To which mortals or Gods can aspire;
Go search in the depths where it glittering lies
Or ascend in pursuit to the loftiest skies.
'Tis an aim for the noblest desire.

What is math but the pursuit of truth? Truth is the prize I aspire to gain. When I work on a challenging math problem, I don't just want to find the answer. I want to know the story behind the problem: Why is it here? Where did it come from? Where is it going? I want to know the pitfalls to avoid and the intuition behind each step in the solution.

For example, I saw a solution to Putnam 1997 A6 on kskedlaya.org. It was correct, but it didn't make sense because the motivation was completely missing. I had to go back and solve the differential equation, or I would never be satisfied. Or take another problem I was trying to solve for the Putnam seminar this year. I reduced it down to a (mostly) tridiagonal matrix, which I already knew the formula for the eigenvalues. But there's missing intuition—why were those the eigenvalues? I had to split it up into two rotation matrices, or again I would feel as if my solution were missing something.

When I approach math problems, I don't just need a solution. I need a beautiful solution. As John Keats writes in his "Ode to a Grecian Urn", "'Beauty is Truth, Truth Beauty.' – that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know." Perhaps it isn't all I need to know, but it is all I want to know. There are certainly some ugly truths that are useful (e.g. I might need to slog through a coordinate geometry bash in a pinch) but the beautiful ones are better.

I really enjoy solving beautiful problems. Sometimes I come up with them myself. For the Lux AI programming competition, I wanted to solve a modified discrete Poisson equation (modified to add varying resistance to each point). I'd just been learning all about the discrete cosine transform while working at Coreform (I was using it to manipulate Chebyshev functions), and so I looked to see if there were any spectral methods to solving the discrete Poisson equation. There were! I coded it up and got it solved in O(n^2 log n) time—quick enough for my purposes. Of course, I then needed to modify it a little. That was the fun part! My code ended up being less than 100 lines long, but it was a beautiful 100 lines.

Throughout my life, I hope to continue to solve beautiful math problems in my pursuit of the truth.
