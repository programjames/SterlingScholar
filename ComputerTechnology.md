In tenth grade I noticed Timpview didn't have a computer science club, so I created one. I came up with coding problems and made "lecture notes" for club meetings on topics like breadth first search or merge sort, staying up past midnight some weeks getting ready for the meeting. I only had a few active members, but it was fun to teach them stuff they wouldn’t otherwise learn at school. The next year all my members disappeared—I would show up, wait fifteen minutes, and then text my friends to come because no one else showed up—so I stopped running the club. I was disappointed, but I couldn’t force people to like computer science.

Also, I should point out that Timpview does have a Girls Who Code club which was unaffiliated with my club. From my understanding, Girls Who Code is to help girls get interested in all kinds of programming, whether it be designing webpages or setting up servers. My computer science club, on the other hand, focused on just the computer science aspect of programming. Many of the people who came didn't know how to code but could still appreciate the algorithms we learned about. Also, boys and girls were welcome in my club, and we did have both genders come. Yes, boys are technically allowed to participate in Girls Who Code (I was actually invited to join by the president), but it's a less welcoming environment.

**Describe two or three unique things about yourself and relate them to your category. If possible, include challenges you have overcome and describe any distinctive experiences that have affected you.**

I'm a twin, and in ninth grade I took several AP science and math classes (e.g. AP Computer Science) with the juniors and seniors. This led to the issue where lots of people knew *of* me, but no one actually knew me. Random juniors and seniors would come up to me in the halls and ask, "Are you the Camacho twins? I've heard all about you!" It was weird, even a little creepy. I didn't know them, and I had no clue how they'd heard of me or why they thought it was appropriate to invade my mental space like that.

Plus, had they really heard all about me? If so, then why was I just called one of the Camacho twins? I was lucky to get a James-or-Joseph-but-I-can-never-remember-which-one-you-are. If they'd heard all about me, then how come they didn't even know the color of my skin? Many people thought I was Asian, because surely if someone's good at STEM they must be Asian, and Camacho kinda sounds Asian-esque if you pronounce it Cuh-mah-chew. No, I'm not Asian, and no, I'm not just one half of a set of twins. I'm just as distinctive of a human being as every other human on the planet.

It was frustrating. I made a few friends at cross country and in the freshman classes I was taking, and it was nice to be treated like a person by them. But the pestering by the upperclassmen never did stop, not until they aged out of high school. It bothered me to be entirely identified by just one piece of my identity. I didn't just love math and science, I liked running, playing the piano, even Fortnite too! I wasn't a mythological mathemagician—I was just another person, the same as them.
