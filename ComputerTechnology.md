While running the computer science club I came across this competition hosted by the ACM club at UCSD called "Energium". The goal of the game was to mine the most energy by building bots and preventing them from breaking down. I'd tried to get my club to participate in Battlecode a few months prior, but I noticed many people seemed to struggle with how complicated the game was (just setting everything up on your computer took several hours). This was a simpler game so I hoped it would be easier to get started with.

I noticed there wasn't documentation yet, so I created [some](https://github.com/programjames/acmai2020docs/blob/gh-pages/index.md) to make the barrier even lower to start. Unfortunately no one else in the club ended up doing it. I still went ahead and did it on my own though, and ended up placing first. My strategy was based on qtables, an idea from machine learning. I attached a score to each square (initially set to the amount of energy there), and updated the score dozens of times based on the neighboring values. I have a more detailed writeup on my [GitHub](https://github.com/programjames/acmai2020) repository for the competition.

In tenth grade I noticed Timpview didn't have a computer science club, so I created one. I came up with coding problems and made "lecture notes" for club meetings on topics like breadth first search or merge sort, staying up past midnight some weeks getting ready for the meeting. I only had a few active members, but it was fun to teach them stuff they wouldn’t otherwise learn at school. The next year all my members disappeared—I would show up, wait fifteen minutes, and then text my friends to come because no one else showed up—so I stopped running the club. I was disappointed, but I couldn’t force people to like computer science.

Teaching others math is so fun! I text my friends math problems on a regular basis, e.g. find the maximum value of x₁x₂+x₂x₃+⋅⋅⋅+xₙx₁ if x₁+x₂+⋅⋅⋅+xₙ=0 and x₁²+x₂²+⋅⋅⋅xₙ^2=1. I give them a few days to stew over it, and if they can't figure it out I teach them how to do it using Lagrange multipliers and eigenvalues.

I don't just teach math, I also love the other STEM subjects! Just a few months ago at the end of term, a friend texted me desperately needing help in her AP chemistry class. I spent five hours helping her review molarity and gas laws, and yes, she did end up getting an A.

I'm constantly inviting people to Math Club, Computer Science Club, and Science Bowl. I find coding or math contests on my own, and then tell my friends to take them with me (e.g. the CodinGame Spring 2020 challenge, or the Utah Math Olympiad). I've loved STEM my whole life, and I love helping others love it as much as me.

**Describe two or three unique things about yourself and relate them to your category. If possible, include challenges you have overcome and describe any distinctive experiences that have affected you.**

I'm a twin, and in ninth grade I took several AP science and math classes (e.g. AP Computer Science) with the juniors and seniors. This led to the issue where lots of people knew *of* me, but no one actually knew me. Random juniors and seniors would come up to me in the halls and ask, "Are you the Camacho twins? I've heard all about you!" It was weird, even a little creepy. I didn't know them, and I had no clue how they'd heard of me or why they thought it was appropriate to invade my mental space like that.

Plus, had they really heard all about me? If so, then why was I just called one of the Camacho twins? I was lucky to get a James-or-Joseph-but-I-can-never-remember-which-one-you-are. If they'd heard all about me, then how come they didn't even know the color of my skin? Many people thought I was Asian, because surely if someone's good at STEM they must be Asian, and Camacho kinda sounds Asian-esque if you pronounce it Cuh-mah-chew. No, I'm not Asian, and no, I'm not just one half of a set of twins. I'm just as distinctive of a human being as every other human on the planet.

It was frustrating. I made a few friends at cross country and in the freshman classes I was taking, and it was nice to be treated like a person by them. But the pestering by the upperclassmen never did stop, not until they aged out of high school. It bothered me to be entirely identified by just one piece of my identity. I didn't just love STEM, I liked running, playing the piano, even Fortnite too! I wasn't a programming phenomenon—I was just another person, the same as them.

**How do you think your involvement in this category will enrich your life?**

It already has! A few months ago I was working on a competition similar to Energium (called Lux AI). One issue I remembered from my Energium code was that the qtable didn't converge fast enough. It needed hundreds to thousands of iterations to converge, but I only had the computing time to do dozens, maybe hundreds. I wanted a faster algorithm.

I'd just taken Numerical Methods at BYU (MATH 411, but really a CS class), so I recognized my qtable update was very similar to a discrete poisson equation. I was also doing CS research with Coreform at the time, and was learning a lot about the discrete cosine transform (DCT). I read some papers on my own, and found a way to solve the discrete poisson equation using the DCT. Great. But my problem was slightly different, as there were extra terms along the matrix diagonal.

I was now much more invested in solving this algorithmic problem than actually participating in the competition. I stayed up late, munching on some baby carrots to stay fueled, and scribbling through leaves of paper, probably killing a few trees as I worked on this problem. Eventually, I derived a solution using the Woodbury matrix identity, which separated out those pesky terms into an infinite sum. I typed up my solution, and it worked (after some debugging, of course)!

This is when I realized just how far I'd come in computer science. Just five years previously I had been struggling to commit code to GitHub, but now I could take a complicated algorithm, read research papers on the subject, and then derive my own solution with some advanced linear algebra. I didn't end up competing in Lux AI, but I had a lot of fun working on this particular problem. I know in the future I'll continue to be able to work on interesting problems in computer science.
