In seventh grade I moved to a different school in Albuquerque, one that didn't have a Science Bowl club. However, I was surprised to find several of my elementary school friends had transferred that same year too! We formed a club together, and began preparing for the regional competition. We barely had enough people to form a team, but we were dedicated! Our "hanging out" after school consisted of buzzer practice in the library, eating pizza over Wikipedia articles on rotational inertia, or learning about blood cell types from András' older brother Ben Zolyomi (who had won the national competition). We spent hours each week together, and as we got good at answering Science Bowl trivia we grew closer as a team. They became my best friends, and when we won our region, we were ecstatic to fly out together to the national competition.

I've participated in Science Bowl in four different schools across four different regions. One thing I've found, no matter where I'm at, are amazing people like András Zolyomi. I found them when I first moved to Utah, where we competed in the Idaho region (this was before Utah got its own region) and I met this one really smart, bright kid who made me feel disappointed about winning. I saw it at the Nevada regional, with students who were taking organic chemistry while in high school. I wished he could have won too! I've seen it at Timpview, where some of coolest kids congregate in the Science Bowl club. Whether in New Mexico, Nevada, Idaho, or Utah, every Science Bowl club and region I've participated in is brimming with people just like them.

I've had a lot of success in Science Bowl—I've been able to represent Utah twice at the national competition, and other regions twice while in middle school—and I've learned so much from studying for it. But more important than knowing the difference between ionic and covalent bonds are the bonds I made with others.

**List up to six activities, honors and awards that relate to leadership qualifications.**

As Math Club President, I was in charge of scheduling meetings and organizing competitions. I sent out weekly emails about our Math Madness ranking and when our next match would be, and I helped people register for the AMC 10/12B contest at BYU. When the Utah State Math Contest got cancelled, I organized everyone to take the Utah Math Olympiad (a smaller contest run by Hiram Golze around the same time), and we had seven people show up for the three-hour long exam. Finally, I decided to do something new: In our off weeks (from Math Madness) I taught the club about some of the coolest math topics including generating functions, expected value, and zero-sum games.

Also, I'd like to give a huge shoutout to Mrs. Crosland for bringing treats every week to Math Club and proctoring *a lot* of math competitions for us.

Teaching others math is so fun! I text my friends math problems on a regular basis, e.g. find the maximum value of x₁x₂+x₂x₃+⋅⋅⋅+xₙx₁ if x₁+x₂+⋅⋅⋅+xₙ=0 and x₁²+x₂²+⋅⋅⋅xₙ^2=1. I give them a few days to stew over it, and if they can't figure it out I teach them how to do it using Lagrange multipliers and eigenvalues.

I don't just teach math, I also love the other STEM subjects! Just a few months ago at the end of term, a friend texted me desperately needing help in her AP chemistry class. I spent five hours helping her review molarity and gas laws, and yes, she did end up getting an A.

I'm constantly inviting people to Math Club, Computer Science Club, and Science Bowl. I find coding or math contests on my own, and then tell my friends to take them with me (e.g. the CodinGame Spring 2020 challenge, or the Utah Math Olympiad). I've loved STEM my whole life, and I love helping others love it as much as me.

**Describe two or three unique things about yourself and relate them to your category. If possible, include challenges you have overcome and describe any distinctive experiences that have affected you.**

I'm a twin, and in ninth grade I took several AP science and math classes (e.g. AP Chemistry) with the juniors and seniors. This led to the issue where lots of people knew *of* me, but no one actually knew me. Random juniors and seniors would come up to me in the halls and ask, "Are you the Camacho twins? I've heard all about you!" It was weird, even a little creepy. I didn't know them, and I had no clue how they'd heard of me or why they thought it was appropriate to invade my mental space like that.

Plus, had they really heard all about me? If so, then why was I just called one of the Camacho twins? I was lucky to get a James-or-Joseph-but-I-can-never-remember-which-one-you-are. If they'd heard all about me, then how come they didn't even know the color of my skin? Many people thought I was Asian, because surely if someone's good at STEM they must be Asian, and Camacho kinda sounds Asian-esque if you pronounce it Cuh-mah-chew. No, I'm not Asian, and no, I'm not just one half of a set of twins. I'm just as distinctive of a human being as every other human on the planet.

It was frustrating. I made a few friends at cross country and in the freshman classes I was taking, and it was nice to be treated like a person by them. But the pestering by the upperclassmen never did stop, not until they aged out of high school. It bothered me to be entirely identified by just one piece of my identity. I didn't just love math and science, I liked running, playing the piano, even Fortnite too! I wasn't a science superstar—I was just another person, the same as them.

**How do you think your involvement in this category will enrich your life?**

I've planned to be a mathematician even as far back as first grade. Back then I was barely learning my times tables, and didn't know exactly what being a mathematician entailed, but the more I've learned the more I've loved the career. I did applied math research with Coreform over the summer, and it was fun to use generating functions to collapse a recursive algorithm into a clean two lines of code, or use the discrete cosine transform to multiply Chebyshev vectors in O(n log n) time instead of O(n^2). I've already been able to use the math I've learned to work on interesting problems. I know that in the future I'll continue to use it every day.
